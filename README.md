# Analysis of Dominant Factors of CO2 Emissions
### *Objective:* 
This project is designed for figuring out <u>***whether person's income is the dominant factor of CO2 emissions***</u> and <u>***any important factors correlated to CO2 emissions***</u>. To facilitate the project, I use datasets from <u>***[GAPMINDER](https://www.gapminder.org/data/)***</u>, including:
- CO2 emission per person
- GDP/capita (US\$, inflation-adjusted) -> shows countries' economy
- Income per person (GDP/capita, PPP\$ inflation-adjusted) -> shows person's income
- Population
- Happiness score (WHR)
- Sustainable Development Index
- Military expenditure (% of GDP)
- Agriculture (% of GDP)
- Industry (% of GDP)
- Services (% of GDP)
- Number of people using internet
